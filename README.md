## CSV to PZFX file converter  
A CSV to PZFX file converter developed in Python using TKinter, XML and  CSV libraries. Made for converting output files for Cartilage Tissue Engineering Lab at UCF. It is used for converting CSV files from some machine to the GraphPad Prism file (PZFX) in order to further make the analysis of the received data. 

You can run the program with the following command:  
`python main.py` changing the filename variable to the name of your file. Currently, it is set to the test filename, which I have used during the development.

## TO-DO LIST:
- [ ] Develop more user-friendly GUI
- [ ] Fix the warnings about the file from the GraphPad Prism
- [ ] Add different algorithms of formatting the PZFX file
- [ ] Add more comments to the code
